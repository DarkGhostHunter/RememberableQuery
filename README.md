# Rememberable Queries

Remember your Query results using only one method. Yes, only one.

    User::latest()->where('name', 'Joe')->remember()->get();

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4 or PHP 8.0
* Laravel 6.x, 7.x or 8.x
* A working brain

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require darkghosthunter/rememberable-query
```

## Usage

Just use the `remember()` method to remember a Query result. That's it.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User;

$query = DB::table('users')->remember()->where('name', 'Joe')->first();

$eloquent = User::where('name', 'Joe')->remember()->first();
```

The next time you call the **same** query, the result will be retrieved from the cache instead of running the SQL statement in the database. 

> If the result is `null` or `false`, it won't be remembered, which mimics the Cache behaviour on these values.

### Time-to-live

By default, queries are remembered by 60 seconds, but you're free to use any length, Datetime, DateInterval or Carbon instance.

```php
User::where('name', 'Joe')->remember(today()->addHour())->first();
```

### Custom Cache Key

By default, the cache key is an MD5 hash of the SQL query and bindings, which avoids any collision with other queries. You can use any string, but is recommended to append `query|{key}` to avoid conflicts with other cache keys in your application.

```php
User::where('name', 'Joe')->remember(30, 'query|find_joe')->first();
```

### Custom Cache

In some scenarios, using the default cache of your application may be detrimental compared to the database performance. You can use any other Cache by telling the Service Container to pass it to the `RememberableQuery` class (preferably) in your `AppServiceProvider`.

```php
public function boot()
{
    $this->app
        ->when(\DarkGhostHunter\RememberableQuery\RememberableQuery::class)
        ->needs(\Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository::class)
        ->give(function () {
            return cache()->store('redis');
        });
    
    // ...
}
```

## Mind the gap

There are two things you should be warned about. 

### Operations are **NOT** commutative 

Altering the Builder methods order may change the automatic cache key generation. Even if they are *practically* the same, the order of statements makes them different. For example:

```php
<?php

DB::table('users')->remember()->whereName('Joe')->whereAge(20)->first();
// "query|fecc2c1bb6396e485d94eede60532937"

DB::table('users')->remember()->whereAge(20)->whereName('Joe')->first();
// "query|3ac5eba7cd0ef6151481bdfe46f6c22f"
```

If you plan to _remember_ the same query on different parts of your application, it's recommended to set manually the same Cache Key to ensure hitting the cached results.

### Only works for SELECT statements

The nature of remembering a Query is to cache the result automatically. 

Caching the result for `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `INSERT` operations will cache the result and subsequents operations won't be executed, returning unexpected results.

Don't use `remember()` on anything that is not a `SELECT` statement.
